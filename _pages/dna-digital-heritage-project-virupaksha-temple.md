<p>CLIENT : MICROSOFT RESEARCH INDIA</p>
<p>OUR ROLE : CREATIVE DIRECTOR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are worked in collaboration with Microsoft Research India (MSRI) to develop super-cool Hampi demo as part of the Digital Heritage project which launched in January 2011. Our aim was to document both built and intangible heritage at this world heritage site using the most compelling technologies that MSRI researchers create. The digital narratives we showcased leverage the Rich Interactive Narratives (RIN) technology developed by MicrosoftÂ® Research. RIN offers a way to seamlessly combine cinematic experiences with user exploration to create rich interactive and immersive narratives.</p>
