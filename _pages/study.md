Jaaga Study is an open learning environment set up to help young people become technology professionals, and pioneer a simple sustainable way of living in nature. It takes place at [Hamsah Organic Farm](https://facebook.com/hamsahorganic/) just outside Bangalore. Participants live in tents or huts in a mango orchard. We do yoga weekday mornings, volley ball or basketball many afternoons, share food and enjoy a relaxed way of being.

There are a couple ways to be at Jaaga Study:

## Open Study
A plethora of high quality learning material is freely available on the internet, but it can be hard to get through it with the usual distractions that come from living at home. The Jaaga Open Study program provides a fun collegiate space for people who know what they want to study and have the necessary self confidence and discipline to learn on their own. We ask open study participants to stay for the whole quarter, to be clear up front about their learning path and goals for the quarter, to blog regularly about their progress, participate in some community activities and present what they’ve learned at a final ‘Demo Day’ like event at the end of the quarter. Open Study participants can choose what they like to study. We are especially excited to invite people getting into machine learning, chatbots, web development and Ethereum smart contracts.

## Web Development Bootcamp
For people who would like more structure to help them achieve their goals [Rajanshu Ujjwal](http://rajanshu.me) is conducting a Web Development Bootcamp. Rajanshu maintains a schedule with daily stand-up meetings, workshops, pair-programming sessions, projects, outings & mentor sessions. Rajanshu generally follows the FreeCodeCamp.com curriculum, but also has students work through challenges on HackerRank.com and create projects on GitHub that use REACT and a database. He works to place graduates into internships with local startups near Bangalore once they get the FreeCodeCamp.com Web Developer Certificate, a badge on HackerRank, and a GitHub portfolio with significant projects.

## Digital Nomads
People who want even less structure or can’t stay for the whole quarter can still experience life at the farm with Jaaga Study by coming in as a ‘Digital Nomad’. There are no explicit requirements of digital nomads, though we encourage people to participate in activities and engage with the community in a positive meaningful way. Nomads pay 5000/- INR for their first week on the farm and 3000/- INR for each week there after.
