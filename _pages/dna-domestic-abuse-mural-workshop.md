<p>A group of 4 girls from Canadian International School chose Domestic Abuse as a research topic for one of their project works. The team conducted research, filmed, documented and designed a public awareness campaign to reach out to larger audience. Shreya, team point of the project chose art as a creative medium of expression to share her teamâ€™s findings. She decided to take this project to a public space to spread awareness, and approached Jaaga DNA to work with her. We loved her enthusiasm and commitment, and supported the group in conceptualizing their artwork for public space. The group painted a mural on one of the pillars of KH Double road at Richmond circle. The artwork depicts two hands rising from the ground holding strong a purple ribbon symbolically pointing to the issue of domestic abuse.</p>
