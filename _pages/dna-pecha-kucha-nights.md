<h3 id="alfonsknogl1shanthiroad">Alfons Knogl – 1ShanthiRoad</h3>
<p>Alfons Knogl is deeply interested in the context and connection of sculpture, furniture, interior design and music as forms of culture. In Bangalore he has worked on a sculptured series of bowls (Schalen) and coffee tables as well as a musical piece arising from impressions of the cultural and social codes prevalent in Bangalore. In doing so he has studied the existing dynamic between the economic development of India and the underlying structure and layers of Indian society.</p>
<h3 id="annamarzianosrishtiartschoolandexperimentafilmfestival">Anna Marziano – Srishti Art School and Experimenta Film Festival</h3>
<p>Anna is a filmmaker who, during her residency, shot a chapter of her new essay-film in which fragments of conversations explore and question human relationships and family structures, in light of the cultural determinations we receive from culture and mass media. This open meditation moves through different countries – India, Germany, Italy, France – as well as through different possibilities and difficulties of composing desire and reality, freedom and responsibility, the one and the many.</p>
<h3 id="dijanazoradanaelfadivoyuvachintanafoundation">Dijana Zoradana Elfadivo – Yuva Chintana Foundation</h3>
<p>Dijana Zoradana has worked with children to collate a body of work on the idea of “Self and Identity” using the medium of textile and fabric. To this end, she conducted a series of workshops ranging from 7 -10 days collating different aspects of their work together.</p>
<h3 id="fabianhessejaaga">Fabian Hesse – Jaaga</h3>
<p>Fabian Hesse is a visual artist working with installation and 3D printing from Munich. He works with the paradox, the transmission and connection between the digital form of data and the datum of haptic material matter in spatial and social situation. Here in Bangalore, Fabian is working on a new 3D printer specifically exploring printing in greater volumes. Kai &amp; Angelique – Jaaga Kai and Angelique’s project, “A Room of One’s Own,” uses Virginia Woolf’s essay as a starting point and prism through which to explore contemporary Indian society. The study is combination of theatre and social work, Kai and Angelique’s backgrounds respectively, specifically addressing the issue of gender relations and people’s actions within their societal contexts. Further, the work seeks to question how the artists, as a theatre maker and a social worker, can avoid cultural imperialism.</p>

<p>The first PKN (Volume 11) in Bangalore this year 2013 will be Trash Talk.</p>
<p>Produced by Venkataramanan Associates (VA), PechaKucha Bangalore started in 2006 with MOD Institute and JAAGA joining as event partners in 2010. PechaKucha Bangalore aims to capture the essence of a city where interesting attempts, small or big, are constantly being made in an attempt to achieve innovations that are truly Indian</p>
<p>Bangalore has begun to fight its garbage problem, but weren’t we all already? This PechaKucha Bengaluru will see speakers dive into the depths of the discarded, pulling out stacks of critical and cultural debris: garbage collection, scrap art, city planning, rubbish music, trashy movies and other things from the dumpster. From the serious to the arcane, the joyful to the profane, this grown-up version of show-and-tell – 20 slides for 20 seconds each – will be sure to leave you breathless (not to mention the cheap drinks and great conversations!)</p>
