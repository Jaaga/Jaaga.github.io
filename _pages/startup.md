# Would you like a community help you build your business? Read on.

## We maintain a balanced community with the various skills that a startup needs
Our coworkers come with a collaborative spirit and skills that fill gaps in other teams. Regular skill sharing sessions and a culture that promotes openness helps you build your startup better, faster.

## Our partners can help you deliver better products and services
We have an extensive [list of partners](/startup/benefits/) ranging from cloud services to accounting. They offer free resources and advice on how to build and deliver your products and services the right way.

## Experience a fresh, open space that adapts to your needs
We don't do cubicles and we quite like greenery - most people who walk in are amazed that such a space exists in the centre of the city! And since it's your space we are very responsive to your needs of our community - like adding 24x7 power backup or helping set up a learning centre for kids!

## All work and no play makes for a boring startup
Join our frisbee and football teams, we play every week and hold regular training sessions. Or pick up one of many indoor games available in the space if that's more your style.

Join the 100s of coworkers who have made Jaaga a unique offering in coworking since 2009!
