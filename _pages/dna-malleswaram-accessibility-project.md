<p>The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) in partnership with Jaaga initiated a project for Neighbourhood Accessibility Planning in Malleswaram on October 15th, 2011. The objective of this project is to take a stock of the existing environment for non-motorized transport and to assess the problems faced by the local people especially the elderly, children and differently abled in making use of the available infrastructure and to formulate a project with consultations and community engagement of residents and users of Malleswaram for the improvement of existing infrastructure. This is with the idea of transforming the neighbourhood from a traffic-congested commuter street into a more environmentally and culturally conscious, pedestrian and bicycle-friendly locality through a participatory process of planning and designing. In February 2012 the MAP team completed the first phase of the project with a grand finale â€“ Malleswaram Moves! an urban neighbourhood festival showcasing the 2000 surveys, community engagement, and process followed to the Malleswaram community. Now, the team is working on the final report that will catalog the efforts gone into the project as well as recommendations, based on public input, on how further work can be conducted. <a href="https://yourmap.wordpress.com/">MORE </a>&gt;&gt;</p>
