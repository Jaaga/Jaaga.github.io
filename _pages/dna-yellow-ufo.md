<h2 id="yellowufowasacommunitydrivenprojectwherepassersbywereinvitedtoposeinresponsetotheideaofplaywithobjectsofjoyundertherichmondcircleflyover">“Yellow UFO” was a community-driven project where passers-by were invited to pose in response to the idea of “play” with objects of “joy” under the Richmond Circle flyover.</h2>
<p>Throughout this three-week participatory process, the community was invited to take part to the creation and to the ideation processes, resulting into a 20-pillars colorful artwork in the heart of the city. Reclaiming this derelict urban space by transforming it along with the community was for Jaaga a way to offer a common space for exchange and ephemeral collaborations to raise civic awareness. The project was a collaboration with artists Archana Prasad, Athreya Chidambi, Kamya Ramachandran, Vivek Chockalingam and Sharwari Tilloo.</p>
