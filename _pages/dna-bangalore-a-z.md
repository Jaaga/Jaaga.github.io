From ‘Autorickshaw’ to ‘Zebra Crossing’, the entries are dispersed throughout the publication alongside some visual references. The inspiration for this publication is the Indian Ledger Book, the omnipresent account book where everything seems to be noted down: visitors, transactions, receipts etc. A huge bureaucratic effort that is a legacy of the British colonial past.</h3>
<p>In close collaboration with Chandra Mouli from Grafiprint, Anja Lutz developed the form of this publication, referencing the Ledger Books in terms of paper quality, two colour printing, binding technique, edge colouring, embossing, and so on. Taking the possibilities and techniques of this traditional printing house into consideration, the Bangalore A-Z is printed on a 1974 Heidelberg one-colour off-set press, it is machine stitched and hand-bound with a half-calico hardcover. The foil embossing on the cover was executed with a 1952 letterpress by Maya Machinery of Calcutta. The edge colouring is done by hand with pigments that are traditionally used in religious ceremonies. The project is conceived by Anja Lutz, a book designer from Berlin and current Goethe-Institut BangaloREsident at Jaaga. The book release will take place at the print house Grafiprint, originally known as Judge Press – a beautiful and intricate place. The exhibition includes a video art piece that captures the experiential process of the books production. Filmed by Anja Lutz, with sound designed by Martin Lutz. Let’s end this with some amazing pictures of the book and artist:</p>
