<p>In collaboration with Vialka and with the support of Swissnex our artists in residence – Eric Boros and Cedric Carles developed a solar powered audio system that would work for large gatherings. They had a concert – Rock the Sun, that demonstrated the system and also did an India tour with it. If you would like to use the system please get in touch with us. <a href="http://vimeo.com/39471453">Click for Video</a> &gt;&gt;</p>
