<p>Our German artist in residence, Jérôme Chazeix, assembled different media – sculpture, video, music, costume, and performance into a seamless installation that took to the streets, under the Richmond Road flyover. He worked closely with our team and invited artists to develop this work using local visual language and cultural cues.</p>
