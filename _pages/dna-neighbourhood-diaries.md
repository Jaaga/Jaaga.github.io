<p>Jaaga DNA collaborated with this project primarily on the neighbourhoods of Whitefield and Malleswaram. Neighbourhood Diaries is a project on stories and histories of neighbourhoods. It works at involving the residents of a locality in the process of excavating, documenting and engaging them in discovering secrets, truths and novelties that made their neighbourhood special. The Whitefield Chapter of this project has been funded by INTACH UK. The Malleswaram section was partially funded by Directorate of Urban Land Transport. We are constantly looking for funders, collaborators and supporters to take on more neighbourhoods â€“ so get in touch with us quickly! <a href="http://http://www.neighbourhooddiaries.in/">MORE</a>&gt;&gt;</p>
