<p>DATE : 2009 TO DATE</p>
<p>CLIENT : ARCHANA PRASAD + FREEMAN MURRAY</p>
<p>OUR ROLE : PALLET RACK ARTISTS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaaga is a unique architectural experiment using palette rack shelving material to construct large-scale, multi-storied inhabitable building. To see pictures of Freemans experiments with Pallette Racks before the Jaaga series <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/freeman/sets/72157594251251366">click here</a>. A Jaaga installation was also constructed at <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/freeman-murray-to-set-up-startup-school-in-kochi/article4074480.ece">startup school</a> &amp; in Kochi in 2012. Jaaga is an example of a rack supported building. It is built primarily from heavy duty warehouse shelving components called pallet racks. Meant for supporting pallets of heavy material at multiple levels in a warehouse the pallet rack uprights support loads of 4 tons each and the beams support loads of 1.5 tons per pair. Pallet racks are readily available all over the planet. They can be assembled and modified easily with out the need of cranes or any other special equipment. In the Jaaga designs the buildings are free standing and do not require a significant foundation.

<h2 id="livingbuildingmeta">LIVING BUILDING META</h2>
<p>The Living Building project seeks to extend the notion of the pallet-rack shelving as the skeleton of the living building by evolving the metaphor and design philosophy to include other organs such as tissue made of living vertical gardens and rooftop garden, a circulatory system complete with rainwater harvesting and hydroponic drip irrigation, a digestive system that houses worms which generate beautiful compost out of our organic waste, a metabolic system responsible for taking the energy harvested from our solar panels to light our space, connect us with wireless internet, and drive the pumps that circulate our harvested water.  Eventually the Living Building will even develop a nervous system that senses and communicates.  It is the intent that with each iteration of growth the building comes one step closer to reaching full consciousness.</p>
<h2 id="jaagadoubleroad">JAAGA DOUBLE ROAD</h2>
<p>Jaaga moved to Double Road from its first location in Bangalore on Rhenius Street in July 2011. Its design was informed by the way people used it at its former location. Dedicated space for coworking, events, workshopping, screenings, retail and recreation were created. We had 198 co-work members + 618 events in our 2.3 year journey on Double Road!</p>

<p>Artistic projects that work with the metaphor of a human body-like manifestation of the internet, and play with the idea of building, designing and fleshing out this dream are:</p>
<p><a href="http://jaaga.in/portfolio/jaaga-dhvani/">JAAGA DHVANI : : SPACE VOICE</a></p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2Header-LB.jpg" alt="2Header-LB"></p>
<p>Taking forward the Enlightened Singularity theory, Jaaga Dhvani is a work of Sound Art by New York-based artist Heather Dewey Hagborg. Jaaga Dhvani is, quite literally, the voice of a space – a sonic representation of the Jaaga Building imagined as a living corporeal entity. Jaaga Dhvani is also a voice from space – the space around us in both our immediate and vast conceptions of place; an exploration of Jaaga , Bangalore, and India more generally as a site of collision between the global and the local, the high and the low tech, the very old and the very new. Technically, the voice of Jaaga is composed of recorded fragments of its inhabitants, its language is derived from the syntax and lexicon of the web, its body is crafted from found objects inspired by tribal forms.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Header-SNL2.jpg" alt="Header-SNL2"></p>
<p>How can sound and light play a more intuitive and interactive role in the Jaaga structure? With this basic premise we invited 4 international artists and 4 local artists to ponder, create and innovate of traditional notions of light and sound to create something that came closer to the goals of the living building concept. We used our theory on Enlightened Singularity to be the conceptual framework with which the artists would base their work. The residency of German artist Tobias Rosenberger was kindly supported by Goethe-Institut/Max Muller Bhavan, Bangalore.<br>
ARTISTS: Tobias Rosenberger, Germany, Corin Faife, UK, Andy McWilliams, UK, Agnese Mosconi, Italy, Sharath Chandra, Bangalore, Shruti Chamaria, Bangalore, Pooja Mallya, Bangalore &amp; Jaaga Juice Artist Collective | Program Manager: Mandy Hixson</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Header-SNL22.jpg" alt="Header-SNL22"></p>
<p>Eve Sibley, Allison Kudla and a team of very talented green activists designed and impletemented the Green Wall and Rooftop Gardens. Today Jaaga has a lawn and a vegetable patch up on our roof. We have rotating vertical panels that form the 8 x 10 meter front facade of our building. On these panels local plants grown in circulated water. The reverse side of the panels depict birds converging to form Freddie Mercury’s face using found material and rust. This artwork was made by visiting artist Walker Babington.</p>
