<h2 id="1000cranesproject">1000 CRANES PROJECT</h2>
<p>In collaboration with Tara Trust, Goa, we co-ordinated and ran multiple workshops as part of a 10-day art camp for deprived children across India. Through this initiative, the children get the opportunity to travel to other parts of the country and to work with local resource people, NGOs and other children from similar backgrounds.This project is designed to expose children from the supports projects in Goa to get exposure to the world outside their homes and schools. It acts as a motivator to build self confidence as well as to set future goals. The third Art Camp of its kind that Tara Trust has driven ran in Bangalore from the 17th of April 2013 to 27th of April 2013 in partnership with Jaaga Trust and several local resource people. Our venue hosts are the Indian Institute of Information Technology. It was a great week at this camp. We had football classes and games with the Magic Bus kids, we took them on a tour of the National Gallery of Modern Art and taught them how to screen-print their own tees. In addition, with the support of our friends we pulled together a drum circle with the <a href="http://Drumjam.in">Drumjam.in</a> folks – Vasundhara Das and Roberto Narrain, a movement workshop with Shabari Rao, A Kathak workshop with Vibha Krishnaswami and a theater workshop with Partha and crew. <a href="http://the1000craneproject.blogspot.in/search?updated-min=2013-01-01T00:00:00%2B05:30&amp;updated-max=2014-01-01T00:00:00%2B05:30&amp;max-results=12">MORE</a> + <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjronfhuC80&amp;feature=youtu.be">VIEW VIDEO</a></p>
