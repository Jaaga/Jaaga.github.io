<p>DATE : MAY 2011</p>
<p>OUR ROLE : CURATOR &amp; PRODUCER</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaaga Sound &amp; Lights is the culmination of Jaaga’s three-month residency program with four international artists and three local artists. It is part of the work on-going at Jaaga that explores the intent that with each iteration of growth, the building comes one step closer to reaching full consciousness. The Jaaga Sound &amp; Lights Project aims to create a habitat that is alive, conscious, aware and interactive. The artworks in this curated set of explorations use the idea framework of Enlightened Singularity – an essay written by Jaaga Juice, as a starting point. The gist of this theory is: ‘Enlightened Singularity’ stems from the notion of a continued trajectory from the very first signs of life on this planet to the now, and moving on into the future. This timeline, this trajectory, this multi-layered, multi-pronged movement, is inevitably rushing towards our ‘god’ The Enlightened Singularity ‘The Enlightened Singularity is that point of convergence of all trajectories of the desire and will to create. It is the nucleus of all thought, desire and creative will. It is aware and insistent in ensuring that all creative and thought trajectories meet.</p>

<p>Eve Sibley – Vertical Garden Design &amp; Maintainance Jaaga Sound &amp; Lights is an exploration and celebration of interactive sound and light installation art by 8 international and Bangalore artists. Come on over. The exhibition stays open everyday from the 21st to the 29th of May 2011 from 6.30pm to 10 pm.</p>
<p>Tech Notes: In preparation for this event, the people at PowerUp Electronics have developed a programmable interactive LED controller board with on-board microphones and proximity sensors which can respond to gestures in the immediate vicinity as well as messages from a central building control system. We also use the Microsoft Kinect 3D scanner for gestural interactions with the building, and a Focusrite firewire audio interface with 10 audio outputs to transmit audio around the building. Through this project we would like to push the envelope on lighting and sound systems and human interactions with light and sound.</p>

Murale is a multi-sensorial, modular climbing plant. When the sensors are triggered the wall responds through movement and sounds.  Murale from Latin “muralis “of a wall,” from murus “wall” in italian means both: “climbing plant” and “wall paint”. It is a parasite of the “Living Building” because no system-organism is perfect and “There is no system without parasites” The parasite is a system itself: “The parasite doesn’t stop. It doesn’t stop eating or drinking or yelling or burping or making thousands of noises or filling space with its swarming and din. The parasite is an expansion; it runs and grows. It invades and occupies. It overflows, all of a sudden, from these pages. Inundation, swelling waters” – Michel Serres, The Parasite

Two interconnected pieces – Gravity, an audio/visual installation in the form of a triptych, is a response to the presence of the Jaaga structure; to it’s physicality and textural nature. Reflections, a digital audio work based on extensive interviews, allows the voices of people intimately connected with Jaaga to float freely and share glimpses of their stories. Jaaga’s living building metaphor here is interpreted as the relationship of people inhabiting a space, especially in the context of an imminent relocation.
<p>Sonosphere-1 | Corin Faife | UK To move toward creation, evolution, perfection: this is the tendency of all things. Field recordings made in the Jaaga structure are manipulated, morphed and reborn, unrecognisable. The structure and essence of sound waves dissected and reassembled, computer synthesis realigning microsecs of air pressure transfer. From this laboratory new harmonies emerge into the sonic ecology, their lines of flight a multi-channel surroundscape. The building reads our motions. Stimulation or lack thereof excites or depresses; response manifests through music, further provokes us to (in)/activity. A feedback loop, all things in balance. Symbiosis.

<h4 id="lasyajaagajuicebangalore">Lasya | Jaaga Juice | Bangalore</h4>
<p>This piece, conceived by Freeman Murray, is intended to explore dance and measured movement as meditation and mediation between us and the ‘other’. Using inspiration from Butoh and Tai Chi as free movement forms, this piece communicates with the Jaaga structure through gestural sound &amp; light interactions. It demonstrates the imminent arrival of the Enlightened Singularity by heralding the Living Buildings’ resolutely advancing awareness. ‘Lasya‘ in Hindu mythology is the dance of aesthetic delight that revealed beauty, grace, love and all tender aspects of existence. Lasya is Parvati’s feminine response to the male energy of the cosmic dance of destruction – ‘Tandava,’ performed by Lord Shiva who is part of the Hindu trinity.</p>

Jaagaad is a combination of two words: jaaga, a Hindi word meaning space and, of course, the name of the unique cultural center the piece is housed in. It also refers to ‘jugaad’, which is the idea of improvising with objects, a practice that often stems from making the best of limited resources.
<p>The intention was to create a device that exists in some sort of symbiosis with the unique structure of Jaaga, using cheap, second-hand or found materials. It is installed in Jaaga yet does not take any sort of energy from Jaaga, instead, someone inside the building needs to interact with it in order for it to come to life, where it will add sound to the interior space. Jaaga is also a crossroads for both locals and foreigners, a meeting point to share ideas. All the elements of Jaagaad are techniques I’ve picked up from friends and collaborators during seven months of traveling, which I wish to share with both the Jaaga community and the general community of Bangalore.

“Cues in the Nest” is an installation on the top of the building facade that moves like the breath of the living building, reflecting activity in the building. Its kinetic element plays with light, texture and the visual sense to arouse within those passing by; a curiousity about Jaaga. The breath is the brew
The eye is the clue, as an extension of the mind.
The virtual machine expands into our central nervous system…
the Cambrian explosion revisited…
towards Enlightened Singularity…
Prime Actant | Sharath Chandra | Bangalore
An objective virtual social reality of sonic identities, along with background video art that represents the Living and Transient Building, form a material-semiotic network which is aware of the movements of a participating spectator –‘The Prime Actant’ in this actor network – whose subjective creativity is engaged by the space which invites him to create music and artwork.

Tobias Rosenberger works at the crossroads of media art, visual arts and performance. He claims the space between code and thinking as subjective space, dealing with media as sign systems, whose materiality itself can become significant again. “The action of the multitude — the swarm of singularities — aims at pure living and its dignity. To act means to engage oneself as the subject of this dignity and this life. The dignity of the subject of action does not lie beyond its life as something which transcends this life. The subject is dignified as the subject of its life and this passion to act which brings forth something new, discovers hitherto unknown modalities of the coexistence of singularities.” – Markus Steinweg

<h4 id="agnesemosconiitalydigitalmediadesigner">AGNESE MOSCONI | Italy | Digital Media Designer</h4>
<p>Constantly engaging with new challenges Agnese Mosconi comes from a multidisciplinary background, after a diploma in Fine Arts, she took her BA in Industrial Design in Venice gaining great experience in problem solving and shaping her mind to a tridimensional way of thinking. She then took an MA in Digital Media design at the Course of Communication Design of Central Saint Martins developing a strong interest for Interaction Design. As a result of this interest she conceived “Esperanto 2.0”: a musical, 3D interactive world. A representation of a new way of communicating within New Media, a more intuitive and multi-sensorial experience, where the expression and reception of emotions is more important than logic and rationality and where knowledge is reached in a non-linear and more casual way. The interactive, 3D generated, flash movie is connected through “Pure Data”, a real-time graphical programming environment for audio, video, and graphical processing, to the program for musical production and live performances “Ableton Live”.The production of the final project has been fundamental in gaining various technical skills and cultivating an interest in music and music production as well as an insight into issues surrounding sound design and working in close collaboration with programmers.This experience led therefore to a even more interesting and exciting collaboration with ON101 as a Digital Media Designer for the development of the interactive applications for the Natural History Museum’s Darwin Center.</p>

<h4 id="jaagajuicebangaloreinteractivemediaartscollective">JAAGA JUICE | Bangalore | Interactive Media Arts Collective</h4>
<p>Jaaga Juice, interactive arts hacker-maker collective artists Archana Prasad, Kiran Dsouza, Freeman Murray and Sean Blagsvedt worked on this project. They are super interested in hacking cutting-edge consumer and beta technologies to create artworks that are interactive and sentient. The theoretical framework that we have begun to articulate and are constantly developing are Enlightened Singularity and The Living Building.</p>
<p>The Jaaga structure is our work-in-progress which, in collaboration with artists over time, we will develop into a sentient, nomadic, urban art installation. Our first of our evolutionary series titled Internet Chandlier explored. The second of the series of explorations within this framework, Pray, was showcased in January 2011 as part of the 3For project at Jaaga. It was a call to play or pray to invite awareness into the Jaaga structure.</p>
