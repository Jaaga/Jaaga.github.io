<p>Bangaloreâ€™s contemporary art scene is on the rise. Artists of this city historically have been pushing the boundaries, be it with new media, plastic, academic or performative arts. Today we stand on the edge of something intangible yet emerging. A world that we can, as artists and galleries, comment on and engage with. And we do so with a sense of respectful camaraderie.</p>
<p>DOUBLE ROAD is our two-way street of understanding and support for each others work, spaces and efforts. We use geography to recognise each other and locate ourselves firmly in the heart of the city. We welcome each new player and laud the ones that will come, have gone or shall stay. The contributors on this series of three are Attakkalari, Bar1, 1 Shanthi Road, Gallery SKE, Gallery Sumukha, and Jaaga.</p>
