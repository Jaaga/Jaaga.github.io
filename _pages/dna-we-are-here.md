<p>“We are here” is a project that explores the relation between virtual presence and physical presence and its influence on collective, community and place within cities in a global world. “We are here” is a series of laboratories. The outcomes of the laboratories are shared in a site‐specific participatory intervention in the Mobile Urban Mela at Bangalore in June 2012. It explores the fast blurring borderline via encounters between the artistic fields with the newest technology research to explore the inherent potential for creating meeting spaces, spaces for social action and interaction in city spaces. Artistic Directors Vera Maeder of hello!earth and Archana Prasad of Jaaga, together with selected Indian artists from backgrounds of journalism, dance, multi‐media, visual arts, design and technology research will embark on an exploration of mediated presence and physical presence in the context of Bangalore and the arrival of the Urban Mela, in its center. The Ind0-German Urban Mela is a mobile exhibition travelling through 5 Indian cities as part of the Germany and India 2011-2012 Framework. <a href="http://weareherebangalore.wordpress.com/">MORE</a> &gt;&gt;</p>
