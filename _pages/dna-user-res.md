<p>In preparation for a Google Design Sprint, Jaaga DNA took selected Jaaga Startups through a user-centred design research process. Through a collaborative workshop, startups framed their key design challenges, user research objectives, stakeholders and environment. The workshop was the basis of formulating relevant question sets, enabling startups to craft up-to-date user stories around their products and services.</p>
