<p>Investment Zone is a participatory art work and reality game. Ten citizens in Gelsenkirchen (Germany) and ten citizens in Bangalore (India) are invited to make use of a plot of abandoned land and transform it over the course of six months. Participants come together every two weeks to deliberate, discuss and invest in the development of the plot. In Bangalore, the plot of land is located under the KH Double Road Flyover, a major traffic artery.</p>
